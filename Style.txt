Functions:
1)Class Methods should be lowercase and use underscores to separate words (as will nonconstant variables)			
ex. example_function 

The reason for this is that these functions are (visibly) implemented as table values.

2)Otherwise, functions will be camelcased ex. ExampleFunction

Variables:
1) All nonconstant variables are lower case and if names are compound, component words are separated by underscores ex: example_variable

2)All constant values are all CAPS with underscores ex. EXAMPLE_CONSTANT

3)Booleans should be preceded by a word that implies its type exs: is_, will_,...
